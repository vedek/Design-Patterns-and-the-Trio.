    <h1>The Trio is here! </h1>
    <p>Welcome to AIML is back! Defeat the Unix Plumber with smart AIML generater code, maybe you are in love with Cortana's voice, but don't fret, the Web Voice API, together with new software like mycroft and Google's server, lets you upload your friends voiceprint to the servers! On this site we explore with COredump and the Trio several new design patterns like the repl, wall, state, generator, per-observer and many more.... </p>

    <h2>The Generator Pattern </h2>
    <p>The generator pattern is a code generator and data generator pattern, especially relevant in the present Java release, in conjunction to the Eclipse Collections, based on GS Collections. AIML is adopted to Java and JSON based per-observer pattern. The JSON generator pattern uses AIML and the state pattern with a library of functions and functoids and factoids, HOF and functors to enhance JSON or YAML generators. Integration with parser pattern, use of Jison and yoeman are also mentioned. </p>

    <p>Much of AWS based IaC and almost all of shell scripting is automated with a template and function based AIML , especially using "srai" tag. </p>
     <p> I once met a macro man named e-Undy,<img src="GANESHA.jpg" /> e-Undy represents the color Blue and thought life was just regex's, would AIML with regex based pattern - template substitution make great social engineering, even a child would not buy that, not even an infant, not even designer computable functions in C, with function pointers(!), not even Haskell! Poor Alice, the first digital human with AIML, struggles along, with every linux buff who ever fell for her moving on to more sophesticated digital humans like Ava of ex-machina? Have you conversed with her? RIP, e-Undy </p>

    <p>James of Botlibre.org is another A.I enthusiast and he created a free Bot website with a new scripting language called Self which upgrades AIML, it adds deep learning and a state model, I have mainstreamed AIML in the generator, repl, state, parser, per-observer and RPA patterns, adding all these functionalities to Eclipse Collections.</p>

    <p>The last step is to add avatar engineering to P5.JS with a library, mainstreaming Botlibre's talking avatars, you can use any text based converser, with talking avatars and use a GAN based synthesis from text descriptions to actual animatable avatars, you can mosiac several of these avatars on a canvas in P5 to have a medley conversation, the more the merrier!</p>
